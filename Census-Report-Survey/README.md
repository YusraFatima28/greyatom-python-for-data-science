### Project Overview

 This project deals with manuplating data from an unlabelled dataset Census Report showing various features of a common employee of a country.


### Learnings from the project

 These were the concepts that became handful during completing this project : Boolean Indexing on a numpy array, Slicing , Vectorization ,Advanced indexing, calculating mean sum values of any particular row, column etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Approches like Boolean indexing comes in very useful when you want to extract some particular values from an array given some condition.Numpy eases this task and it can be done with a single line of code. Slicing and indexing were used to simplify the code.Other built in functions of Numpy proved very useful because their memory consumption is small and they give desirable run time behaviour.


### Challenges faced

 Challenges like small indexing and slicing erros were used to terminate the execution of code but with practice you can overcome those also.


### Additional pointers

 It was a fun learning experience :)
