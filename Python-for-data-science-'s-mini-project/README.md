### Project Overview

 This project gives a small overview on managing student's information and other course details.


### Learnings from the project

 I have learned many things like how to extract relevant information from a dictionary or how to store relational databases in python' dictionary and how max min functions can help you in giving right values.Dictionaries can be proved very useful because of their key-value pair relationship.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The tasks were solved with the help of python's datatype dictionary which easily transformed a relational database into a key-value based dictionary.


### Challenges faced

 There were no challenges as it was a kind of fun to play around with dictionaries and exploring easy to opt methods which can make your code short and executable.


### Additional pointers

 it was a great experience!
